# Image classification using CNNs with tensorflow and keras
## 1. Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification
## 2. Place this dataset in a folder named 'dataset' in your project directory.
## 3. Change the structure of this folder as dataset/train,test,val. Inside train and test subfolders for classes(like buildings, forest, sea etc) should be present.
## 4. Install tensorflow(pip install tensorflow).
## 5. run main.py(python3 main.py). You'll get a ImgClassification.keras file as the model with 84% accuaracy(see notebook for performance graphs like epoch vs accuracy and epoch vs loss).
### You can use this keras file to build a web app using any framework(eg flask, django etc)
